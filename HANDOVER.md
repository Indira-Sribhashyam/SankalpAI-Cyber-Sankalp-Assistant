# HANDOVER - How to merge assistant into dashboard

What I built:
- A minimal assistant microservice (FastAPI) that responds to /chat and simple action endpoints.
- RAG documents generation and Chroma indexing scripts.

How to integrate:
1. Add this microservice to your infra (run via Docker or as a separate process).
2. Proxy requests from dashboard to assistant (e.g., /api/chat -> http://assistant:8000/chat).
3. Dashboard should pass user JWT in Authorization header for authenticated tool actions.
4. Replace the dummy llm_call() in assistant_api.py with the real LLM (OpenAI or local model).
5. Secure /action endpoints - require role checks and confirmation flows in UI before calling.

Files to hand over:
- rag_docs_devices.jsonl (generated by prepare_rag_docs.py)
- .chromadb directory (if pre-indexed) or run index_chroma.py to rebuild index.

Contact:
- If you need help merging, provide the repo and where to mount the assistant (service name / path).
